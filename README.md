# Update
new: 
-fix the problem of platform generate on the side wall by having a minimum x coordinate add to the random generator and lower maximum x coordinate

After trying unity, unreal, and godot on my computer, SFML become my choice for this project. I underestimate the difficulty to learn new stuff to make something which slower my
work
# Current
Learning SFML, and Drawing.
Still want to draw a decent visual for this simple game (working on)

# Game info
So far, it will be a vertical jumping game with visuals.

# feature
- players jump on the platform to go higher (working on)
- score ( plan to add)
- ability to use rocket pack(plan to add)









# Requirements:
    - Design and implement a class. 
    - Use subclassing to design simple class hierarchies that allow code to be reused for distinct subclasses.
    - Correctly reason about control flow in a program using dynamic dispatch. 
    - Explain the relationship between object-oriented inheritance (code-sharing and overriding) and subtyping (the idea of a subtype being usable in a context that expects the      supertype).
    - Use object-oriented encapsulation mechanisms such as interfaces and private members.
    - Define and use iterators and other operations on aggregates, including operations that take functions as arguments. 
    - Follow best practices for style and readability
    - Follow best practices for documentation
